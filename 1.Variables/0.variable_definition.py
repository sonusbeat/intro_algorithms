# 1.Variables are used to store values so we can refer to them later.
# A variable is like a label, and you use the '=' symbol, known as
# the assignment operator, to assign a value to a variable.

a = 10
b = c = 20 # This is called a "chained assignment" b = 20, c = 20
print(a)
print(b)
print(c)

greetings = "Hola como estas ? muy bien y tu ?"
print(greetings)

# Variable names contain letters, digits and undescore character '_'

# 1apple = 10 (no good)
# snake_case = 30
# cameCase = "camelCase"
